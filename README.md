# IEEE-NSIT
IEEE-NSIT Student Branch works to create an atmosphere of technical excellence for the students. It aims at helping students in building an aptitude towards applying engineering in daily life by learning ways to use the latest technology on offer. Through this app, students can remain informed about events and news pertaining to IEEE-NSIT.

##Features
###1. Home
Serves as the home page of the app. Displays posts from IEEE NSIT's facebook page. Tap on a post to view text and the associated image (if any).

The blur effect shown above works by taking a low resolution screenshot just as the user taps on a cell, and presenting the new controller modally - with the screenshot masked by a UIVisualEffectView instance. This provides contextual awareness to the user.

###2. Events
Shows a collection of upcoming events organised by IEEE NSIT. Uses a card based interface - swipe between cards to view events.
Features spring animation with damping introduced in iOS 7. Pull down to refresh. Uses the iEE- NSIT-events api.

###3. Push Notifications
Support for push notitications has been added. When a user installs the app for the first time, the device token generated by APNS is uploaded to our database via a POST request. 
For pushing notifications, a fetch request is made to the Facebook graph API using the following URL:
```
https://graph.facebook.com/(Insert Page ID)/posts?limit=1&fields=id&access_token=(Insert API Key)
```
This returns the 'ID' of the newest post on the page. Comparing it with the already stored old ID, the server can decide whether to push a notification.

##How to contribute?
You'll need:
- A mac with OSX El Capitan or later. Don't fret if you don't have a mac! You can run OSX on your Windows PC using Virtual Box. If you like tinkering with your computer, dual boot via Hackintosh
- To learn an iOS programming language(Obj-C or Swift)from a popular online course or book like 'The Big Nerd Ranch Guide'. (This project has been written using Swift 2.2)
- Install Xcode
- To build, fork the repository or download the zip to your computer. If you get a cocoapod error (when a certain dependency can't be found), run pod install for the pods mentioned above and you'll be good to go!
